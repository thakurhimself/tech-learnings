# UI/UX Design. UI/UX stands for user interface/user experience.

## VISUAL ELEMENTS FOR USER INTERFACE DESIGN
Interface design has now become a ubiquitous part of our everyday life through web, apps,
and mobile devices. Over the year it has become more sophisticated, one consistent aspect
has been the Design First approach to interfaces. In other words using formal and commun-
cation strategies of graphic design as the foundation for a way of designing in the 
screen based world. With that in mind this course focuses on the visual elements of inte-
face design. We'll be looking at inteface design through the lens of graphic design and 
visual form.

### How peer review works
Peer review is an important part of design. It's very rare that design happen in isolati-
on. You test is with the audience. With peer review you'll learn more about design.

Critique and feedback are essential parts of the design process. They're essential way to
see if your design is communicating what you intended to an audience.

Tips for peer review:


### What is user interface anyway?
The key components are user and interface. The user is the viewer of the person interact-
ing with the content and the interface is the way they gets the content and how they 
access that content so in a lot of ways you think about the interface as being a bridge
between the user and the content. But that bridge is not totally passive. That bridge can
shape the way the user experiences the content. And there are lots of models in the real
world for how interfaces work if you think about book for instance that's an interface in
itself it's an interface between the reader and the story. The book is just type on paper
but what the reader recieves or experiences is the novel or story itself.

Nowadays everyone recieves pretty much everything through a screen and that screen conne-
ct is a mediating device and what that means is the screen can change the experience.
Take news for example, whether it's a good or bad news depends upon how it is reported.
Marshal Mcluhan famously said that ""The medium is the message"". But in interface design
it's more of a case of the medium affects the message; the medium can shape the message;
and that medium is the interface. 

So the interface shapes the experience. The interface is UI part of the user interface
design and the experience is the  UX part, the user experience part, of the user interfa-
ce design. And if you put both together you've pretty much got control over how everybody
experiences every kind of content.

#### Diffence between UI and UX.
UI is often a term that's used to talk about the interface itself. It's about how it 
looks. It's about visual design and how we access the digital content.

UX is a little bit more about how that digital content feels. What's the experience of it
is? and that is often rooted much more in a non-visual design practice.

It's important to understand these two practices as being different because they often
appeal to different kinds of people who do different kinds of jobs. Visual design is much
more rooted in graphic design and a non-visual design might involve much more research
and planning and testing. So the UI designer is really looking at the interface itself
and the UX designer is often focusing much more on the experience of the user.

UI designer is looking at the surface or visual identity and that's often design driven.
UX designer is looking at content how get the user engaged with that content and this is
often drive by user experience and feedback from the user.
UI/UX designer mostly focus on one thing and little bit on other thing.

This course will be focus on visual design approach to UI. We are going to put form first
approach to design. 22:40
