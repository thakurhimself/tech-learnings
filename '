# API (Applicaion programming interfact)

"What is an API?"

It is set of principles and protocols that enable different software components
to commnunicate and tranfer data. Developers use this to brdige the gap b/w
different distinct chunck of codes.

"How does APIs work?"

![api-illustration](./assets/api-illus.svg)

APIs work by sharing data b/w applications, systems, and devices. This happens
through a request and response cycle. The request is sent to the API, which
retrieves the data and returns it to the user.

1. API client: responsible for starting the conversation by sending the request.
Can be triggered by user or by external events.

2. API requests: An API request will look and behave differently depending on 
the type of API, but typically include the following components:
	* Endpoint: An API endpoint is a dedicated URL that provides access to 
	specific resources. For instance, the /articles endpoint in a bloggin app
	would include the logic for processing all requests that are related to 
	articles.
	* Method: request's method indicates the type of operation the client would
	like to perform on a given resources. 
	HTTP methods: [Http method](https://blog.postman.com/what-are-http-methods/)
	* Parameters: Parameters are the variables that are passed to an API 
	endpoint to provide specific instructions for the API to process. These
	parameters can be included in the API request as part of the URL, in the
	query string, or in the request body.
	* Request headers: Request headers aer key-value pairs that provide extra
	details about the request, such as its content type or authentication creds.
	* Request body: The body is the main part of the request, and it includes 
	the actual data that is required to create, update, or delete a resource. 

3. API server: The API client sends the request to the API server, which is 
responsible for handling authentication, validating input data, and retrieving
or mainpulating data.

4. API response: Finally, the API server sends a response to the client. The API
response typically includes the following components:
	* Status Code: HTTP status codes are the 3 digit codes that indicate the 
	outcome of an API request. Example: 200 - ok; 201 - created - 404 - not 
	found.
	* Response headers: HTTP response headers are very similar to request header
	, except they are used to provide additional information about the server's
	response.
	* Response body: The repsonse body includes the actual data or content the
	client asked for - or an error message if something went wrong
